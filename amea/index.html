We are 100% export Company and our products are successfully sold in over 20 countries worldwide. Our Company Strategy is to build strong business relationships and strategic alliances with reliable partners internationally, that import and distribute our products to their markets. We have the experience the knowledge and the determination to support them effectively, in order to build a long mutually beneficial cooperation. We pride ourselves on supporting the farmers and the local communities that produce the raw materials for our products. These communities rely on us and our work to stay and make a living in their home land, raise their families and work the land their ancestors did for centuries, instead of moving into the large urban centers, deserting their homes, their way of life and their traditions. These are the same traditions that allow generations to continue the craft perfected by their ancestors.</p>
    <p><br />
    If there are three words that best describe our philosophy when it comes to our products these are Quality, Quality, and Quality!</p>
    <p><br />
    All our products are manufactured under the strictest quality assurance and good manufacturing practices (GMP). For our professional QC team quality control means hands-on involvement in every step of the production process, ensuring the quality of the final product. Our manufacturing facilities besides HACCP and ISO 22000, they are certified under B.R.C., and I.F.S. which are top tier accreditations in the modern food manufacturing. Additionally, our facilities have F.C.E. registration numbers with FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) which licenses them to sell to the United States of America.</p>
    <p><br />
      We support Organic Farming, and have included several Organic products in our line. Our Company is certified by D.I.O. for the E.U. and by USDA for the American N.O.P.</p>
